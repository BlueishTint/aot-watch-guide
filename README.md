# Attack on Titan Viewing Guide

## Preface

This guide is meant for people who have never watched Attack on Titan before and want the best viewing experience possible.

I was lucky enough to have a friend who had watched the entire series before me, so he decided which episodes we watched each time. After rewatching it with others, I have a pretty good understanding of what episodes should be watched together and what the natural stopping points are.

Note that this guide assumes you watch a max of one section per day. Attack on Titan is a very complex show, especially with its large cast of characters that come and go quickly. This means that in order to fully appreciate it, you must let every section sink in over at least 24 hours. This gives you enough time to think about what the episode means in relation to the entire plot, what questions it answers, and what new questions it brings up. In fact, if you don't want to go through all the effort of following this guide, or don't have the time to watch all the episodes in a section, you could always just watch one episode every day. I would recommend, however, to stop for 24 hours at each stopping point.

This guide is very opinionated, however it is published on GitHub for a reason. I want it to be as perfect as possible, so if you find anything wrong with it, please let me know by creating an Issue with your comments or a Pull Request with your changes. If you do create a Pull Request, please mention what problem it fixes.
